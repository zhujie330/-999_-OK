        ### What is Deepfake?
        Deepfake technology is a method that uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to synthesize fake images, audio, or videos. By synthesizing facial features of one person onto another person's image, deepfake technology can create very realistic-looking fake content.
        ### Main Techniques of Deepfake
        Deepfake technology relies on several main techniques, including:
        - **Facial Synthesis**: Using deep learning models to synthesize facial features of one person onto another person's image or video.
        - **Voice Synthesis**: Generating realistic-sounding speech using deep learning models to make it sound like it's spoken by a specific person.
        - **Text Synthesis**: Generating text content that can be used to create realistic fake articles, comments, etc.

        ### Methods of Deepfake Detection
        
        Methods for detecting deepfakes are continually evolving, with some common techniques including:
        
        - **Manual Inspection**: Professionals carefully examine details in the imagery to judge if there are any signs of manipulation.
        - **Digital Signatures and Watermarks**: Embedding digital signatures or watermarks into original content to verify its authenticity.
        - **Detection Models**: Using deep learning models to identify features of deepfake content, such as unnatural distortions in facial regions.
